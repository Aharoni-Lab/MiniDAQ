# MiniDAQ
Simplified DAQ for Miniscopes and Minicams. This is effectively a smaller version of the [standard Miniscope DAQ](https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_DAQ_PCB) and does not include easily accessible trigger and sync connections but should support all other functionality of the Miniscope platform.
